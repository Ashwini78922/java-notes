Modifiers:
----------
1. final variable can't be changed.
   final method can't be overridden.
   final class can't be inherited.

2. finally is used in try/catch statement to almost always execute the code. Even when exception is thrown, this block
of code is executed. this is maily used to close open connections till Java 7 but not in Java 7.
Note: Java 7 has introduced the AutoCloseable interface to avoid the unsightly try/catch/finally(within finally 
try/catch) blocks to close a resource. It also prevents potential resource leaks due to not properly closing a resource.
Java 7 – try can have AutoCloseble types. InputStream and OutputStream classes now implements the Autocloseable interface.

3. finalize is called when object is garbage collected. It rarely neends to be modified. It should not be used to release
non-memory resource like sockets, file handles, database connections, etc because these resources are very limited in
number and we never expect when finalize will kick in to release these non-memory resources through finalize()n method.
