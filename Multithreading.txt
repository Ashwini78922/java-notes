2. How to fix concurrency issue: by controlling access to the shared object.
Synchronized i.e. a lock on the method.

3. why is locking of a method for thread safety is called synchronized not locked?When a method or block of code is locked with the reserved “synchronized” key word in Java, the memory (i.e. heap) where the shared data is kept is synchronized. This means,

When a synchronized block or method is entered after the lock has been acquired by a thread, it first reads 
(i.e. synchronizes) any changes to the locked object from the main heap memory to ensure that the thread that has the 
lock has the current info before start executing. After the synchronized block has completed and the thread is ready to relinquish 
the lock, all the changes that were made to the object that was locked is written or flushed back (i.e. synchronized) to the main 
heap memory so that the other threads that acquire the lock next has the current info.
