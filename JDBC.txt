JDBC:
-----

1. Java JDBC is a Java API to connect and execute the queries with the database. JDBC has JDBC driver to connect with
the databse.

2. JDBC driver is a software component which enable Java application to interact with database.

3. There are 4 types of drivers available:
	-JDBC-ODBC bridge driver.
	-Native API driver.(partially java driver)
	-Network Protocol driver.(fully java driver)
	-Thin driver(fully java driver)

4. There are 5 steps to establish a connection between java application and database:
	-Register the driver class.
	-Create connection.
	-Create a statement.
	-Execute queries.
	-Close connection.

4.1. To register a driver class, forNmae() method of Class class is used, it takes string as parameter.
		Class.forname("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");

4.2. To create connection, getConnection() method of DriverManager class is used:
		Connection con= DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:5071:xe","system","password");

4.3. To create statement, createStatement() of Connection interface is used:
		Statement stmt= con.createStatement();

4.4. To execute the queries, executeQuery() method of Statement interface is used:
		ResultSet rs= stmt.executeQuery("Select * from emp");

4.5. To close conncetion:
		con.close();

5. There are 3  types of statement used in JDBC:
	-Statement
	-PreparedStatement
	-ClosableStatement
Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver)
Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe","system","oracle");
Statement stmt=con.createStatement(ResuktSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE, ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE);
ResultSet rs= stmt.executeQuery("Select * from table)
