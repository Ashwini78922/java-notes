Compile time VS Run-Time VS Build-Time

public class ConstantFolding {
    static final  int number1 = 5;
    static final  int number2 = 6;
    static int number3 = 5;
    static int number4= 6;
    
    public static void main(String[ ] args) {
          int product1 = number1 * number2;             //line A
          int product2 = number3 * number4;             //line B
    }
}

Difference between lineA and line B? line A evaluates the product at compile time and line B evaluates the product at run
time.

2. An instance method overrides all the accessible instance methods with same signature defined in superclass.

3. Method overridding(i.e. polymorphic behaviour) is occuring at run-time to determine stored object type.

4. the polymorphism and overridding is applicable to non-sttaic methods(instance methods). Overridding a static method is
known as hiding(static method) or shadowing(when for variables).

5. Methods in a class overload one another if they have the same name and different signatures. Unlike overriding, 
overloading happens at compile time. It knows at compile time based on the method arguments which has been passed.
